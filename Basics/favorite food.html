<h2>Breakfast</h2>
<p><strong>Scrambled eggs and ham</strong> doesn't have to be loaded up with fat and calories. Using egg whites, lean ham, and whole wheat toast turns a traditionally heavy breakfast into a much lighter one that's easy enough for a stress-free morning.</p>

<p>Tobiko California Roll (Sushi)

This <strong>tobiko sushi roll</strong> has a California roll on the inside and is coated with orange tobiko on the outside! This roll is very simple to make, and is one of my favorite ways to use tobiko in sushi! You can apply this same technique to other rolls if you want to use a different filling. If you have green tobiko (wasabi tobiko), black tobiko (squid ink tobiko), or yellow tobiko (citrus fruit tobiko), you can use the same technique to create stunning and delicious tobiko rolls!</p>

<p>This is my go-to recipe for <strong>spaghetti and meatballs.</strong> With a quick 45-minute cook time, its perfect for busy weeknights and always a hit with the whole family (even the picky eaters). The meatballs are juicy, flavorful, and fork-tender—the kind that keep everyone coming back for seconds.</p>
